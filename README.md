# Deezer Angular Application

### This is a basic project showcasing Deezer API integration, basic data handling and view rendering. 
<br/>

## Deezer is an internet-based music streaming service. 

<br />

1.  Users should be able to search for artists.  For every artist found show the artist's picture and the number of fans they have.  On bigger screens, with more available space, also include the total number of albums.

<br />

2.  Clicking/tapping the artist must allow users to see basic information about them, like its total number of fans.  Also show its top 5 tracks along with a list of all their albums.  For every album include the year in which it was released.

<br />

A quick CI pipeline was set up with Netlify so that any merge into the main branch would kick off an automatic build and deploy to the above site. 

## IMPORTANT

Requests go directly to https://api.deezer.com and do not have the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header appended to the requests. Use https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/corsdemo to bypass this and run the demo.
